Supposing you are just one person, there are many other versions of you in the other universes, there are ways to travel, but only a police agency,MVA, can travel only for police procedures. Gabriel Yulaw (Jet Li)is a former MVA agent, who killed another version of himself in self-defense. It made the other versions of him stronger. When Yulaw found out about this, he became power-hungry killing the 122 other versions for two years. After killing Lawless (also played by Jet)and getting captured by his former partner Roedecker (Delroy Lindo) and a new MVA agent Funsch (Jason Statham) Yulaw managed to escape the prison and is trying to kill his last target, Gabe Law (also played by Jet) who is a police officer. He is also at Yulaw's strength. Roedecker and Funsch now have to arrest Yulaw before he can kill Gabe. There is a possibility that the universe could die or make Yulaw invinible. After encountering Yulaw for the first time, Gabe thought that it was his split personality, but it wasn't. Will Gabe be able to confront Yulaw before or after Yulaw ruins his life?\r\n\r\nJet Li ....  Gabe Law/Gabriel Yulaw/Lawless \r\n Carla Gugino ....  T.K. Law/Massie Walsh \r\n Delroy Lindo ....

At first he develops minor abilities such as increased strength, which allows him to fight local criminals and bullies, thus living out his dream of being a superhero, and impressing his attractive next-door neighbor. Things start to get more odd when he is able to shoot webs out of his abdomen. Then he loses control over the force with which he applies his increasingly deadly abilities, as well as his judgment to discern between criminals and jokesters. His dream becomes a nightmare when he starts growing large spider body parts, he's in constant pain, and he develops a nearly insatiable hunger.

It has known actors playing the lead roles, but unfortunately the story is not as well written as it could be. The premise is good, but there is not enough character development, and so leaves the audience wanting more. The action sequences are good, and special effects aren't bad. It obviously was shot on a limited budget, but that really doesn't detract from the film. Bottom line is that it is a watchable film, even entertaining. It just never achieves what most would expect due to a inconsistently crafted story. Worth watching on a rainy day. \r\nRobert Carradine ....  John Burnside \r\n Maxine Bahns ....

In its man-made lagoon, about 40 feet under the water, Sea World opens the Undersea Kingdom, a new set of underwater glass tunnels that have their own control room, and Calvin's friend Philip FitzRoyce is there to do some filming. When Sea World diver Shelby Overman vanishes, everyone is worried. Michael and Kathryn head into the water, where they find a baby great white shark and decide to bring it to Sea World to put it on display, but at Sea World, the baby shark dies. When Overman's body is found, Michael vomits when he sees it. Kathryn looks at the body and knows that the baby shark could not have been the shark that killed Overman, because the baby shark's bite radius is too small its 35-foot-long mother killed Overman. When Kathryn and Michael tell Calvin and Philip about the shark, they all try to evacuate the park, including the park's beach, as they try their best to protect Sea World's visitors from the shark.\r\n\r\nDennis Quaid ....

It didn't offer too much that I hadn't already seen, and even those jokes were delivered pretty badly. But I still love it!! I think that my major attraction to this movie is in that you can never quite tell what the people involved in this production were thinking. There are some gags in this movie that could have been really funny had they been pulled off by somewhat professional people, but the poor craftmanship in someway makes the movie much much better. It's a hard movie to obtain, but I recommend it to anyone who can find it. Even if it's not your kind of film, it should be experienced. \r\n\r\nMichael Phenicie ....  Joe Vogue \r\n Andee Gray ....

To Parrish's surprise, they discover a whole family of Yetis in a cave, and are able to subdue the male and carry it back to civilization, to ship to the USA for study. Subra is forgiven his acts because he was right after all. Wells, meanwhile, phones in the story and Parrish finds his discovery - shipped upright in a meat cooler to maintain its natural environment - detained in the US because Wells' story refers to it as a snowMAN, and a decision must be made whether this is a customs or immigration matter.

The diocese calls in Father Michael (Cross) to fight the powerful demon, known as Daesidarius, or The Unholy. The Father's faith is tested almost to the breaking point as the demon - disguised as a stunningly beautiful lady - attempts to seduce Father Michael into breaking his vows. Father Michael soon learns how the Unholy works - by murdering the sinner in the act of sinning, then sending that person's soul to Hell. Will this one priest's inner strength be enough to stop this monster - or will he join the ranks of the other ill-fated priests?\r\n\r\nRuben Rabasa ....  Father Dennis \r\n Nicole Fortier ....

The story starts with her as a shy, somewhat withdrawn, college student who nonetheless gets involved in a drama club. The director thinks she has talent, but some of the other performers start to get jealous of the attention he gives her. Meanwhile, a reporter investigating Sadako's spiritualist mother thinks there's something very suspicious about the young woman, and arrives on campus to confront Sadako just as a series of strange deaths start sweeping through the drama club. \r\n\r\nYukie Nakama ...

                "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a tale of adventure on the open road. When Dante and Randal (of Clerks fame) get a restraining order to keep the punchy Jay and his hetero life-mate, Silent Bob, from selling drugs in front of the Quick Stop convenience store, their lives are suddenly empty. They find new purpose when their friend, Brodie, informs them a movie is being made featuring two infamous characters based on their likenesses. After visiting one of the creators of the Bluntman and Chronic, Holden McNeil, they set out to get what fat movie cash they deserve and hopefully put an end to people slandering them on the Internet. Along the way, they learn the rules of the road from a hitchhiking George Carlin, ride with a group of gorgeous jewel thieves, and incur the wrath of a hapless wildlife marshal for liberating an orangutan named Suzanne. The quest takes them from New Jersey to Hollywood where a showdown involving the police, the jewel thieves, and the Bluntman and Chronic filmmakers will decide the fate of Suzanne, Jay, Silent Bob, and their good names.\r\n\r\nJason Mewes ....

That is until he decides to make a change: Ventriloquism--hey, a dream's a dream. His family barely pays him enough attention to even dismiss the idea--his mother is only concerned that he eat something, and his father only thinks of his model ships. Steven's sister recently broke off her engagement to an unstable accountant, which makes her career as a wedding planner an emotional minefield. His only supporter is neighbor Fangora--aka Fanny--a suburban punker who has her own aspirations to stardom. After Steven loses his job, things actually start to turn around. He falls for his counselor at the unemployment office, and through the best efforts of Steven and the little friend on his knee, good things start to happen for everyone around him. A restraining order leads to new love, a rock band learns Yiddish, and everything clicks into place at somebody else's wedding.\r\nAdrien Brody ....  Steven \r\n Milla Jovovich ....

As a New Year's Resolution, Bridget decides to take control of her life, starting by keeping a diary in which she will always tell the complete truth. The fireworks begin when her charming though disreputable boss (Hugh Grant) takes an interest in the quirky Miss Jones and the ups and downs of their ill-fated relationship prove hilarious and touching at once.

While no one takes her seriously, with her trashy clothes and earthy manners, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. What she discovers is that the company is trying quietly to buy land that was contaminated by hexavalent chromium, a deadly toxic waste that the company is improperly and illegally dumping and, in turn, poisoning the residents in the area.

                "Christian, a young wannabe Bohemian poet living in 1899 Paris, defies his father by joining the colorfully diverse clique inhabiting the dark, fantastical underworld of Paris' now legendary Moulin Rouge. In this seedy but glamorous haven of sex, drugs and newly-discovered electricity, the poet-innocent finds himself plunged into a passionate but ultimately tragic love affair with Satine, the club's highest paid star and the city's most famous courtesan. Their romance is played out against the infamous club - a meeting place of high life and low, where slumming aristocrats and the fashionably rich mingled with workers, artists, Bohemians, actresses and courtesans.\r\n\r\nNicole Kidman ....

In Va savoir, the characters, all quick-witted, well-read and cultured types, revolve around each other in a delightful potpourri of theatre, romance and theft. In the end, everything lands on its feet and they all get the partner they deserve, but before then, long filmer Rivette takes two and a half hours to dwell lightly on the vicissitudes around the six protagonists. Camille is an actress with an Italian company that is in Paris to perform a play by Pirandello, Come tu mi vuoi. Her boyfriend Ugo is the director and the company's most important actor. Both have a hidden agenda for their trip to Paris: Camille meets her ex Pierre, a professor of philosophy, while Ugo is secretly researching a supposedly lost play by Goldoni. In the archives, he is assisted by the charming student Do, who steals his heart. In turn, Do has a link with Pierre: her stepbrother, the playwright Arthur, namely steals an expensive ring from Pierre's wife Sonia. After many sophisticated conversations, secret rendezvous and references to Pirandello, events reach a hilarious climax when Pierre and Ugo challenge each other to an old-fashioned duel for life and death.\r\n\r\nJeanne Balibar ....

                "Set amongst the rolling hills of Western Pennsylvania's once prosperous coal country, Out of the Black is a suspensful, compelling tale of two brothers, Cole and Patrick Malby, and their quest to unravel the mysteries surrounding their father's death. Based around the true story of one of the countries worst mining accidents on record, this heartfelt drama follows the plight of two brothers' quest for the truth. Hiding from their past and keeping to themselves, the two young men afford a meager, day by day existence, working their small, dilapidated farm. But all that is about to change, when a strange woman, Cait MacLochlainn, arrives in town to find her long lost father, a man she's never met. Through a series of events, Cole reluctantly resolves to help Cait locate her father. The result proves to be a profound journey of personal truths, freedom and, finally...love.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyler Christopher...Cole Malby\r\nSally Kirkland...Elizabeth Malby\r\nJason Widener...Patrick Malby\r\nJack Conley...Sheriff Masterson\r\nDee Wallace...Penny Hart(as Dee Wallace-Stone)\r\nJacqueline Pinol...Cait McLachlan(as Jacqueline Aries)\r\nJohn Capodice...Dirk Hobson\r\nTom Atkins...Eugene Carter\r\nMiles O'Keeffe...Cal Malby\r\nAllison Lange...Ann\r\nSally Struthers...Betty\r\nMichael J.

Their life, though unusual, is satisfying until one day, a man named Barry Kolker (that her mother refers to at first as \"The goat man\") comes into their lives, and Ingrid falls madly in love with him, only to have her heart broken, and her life ruined. For revenge, Ingrid murders Barry with the deadly poison of her favourite flower: The White Oleander. She is sent to prison for life, and Astrid has to go through foster home after foster home. Throughout nearly a decade she experiences forbidden love, religion, near-death experiences, drugs, starvation, and how it feels to be loved.

And all of their friends are the same as any other teen movie: Areola, the naked foreign exchange student (Cerina Vincent), Les, the beautiful weirdo (Riley Smith), Malik, the token black guy (Deon Richmond), the desperate virgins (Cody McMains, Samm Levine, and Sam Huntington), Amanda Becker, the perfect girl (Lacey Chabert), Ricky, Janey's obsessed best friend (Eric Jungmann), and Sadie, the VERY old undercover reporter (Beverly Polcyn).\r\n\r\nChyler Leigh ....

The Asguard believed they had trapped the replicators with a device that would slow down time, but it seems to have failed. They need SG-1 to enter replicator infested space, find the time dilation machine and reset it. When SG-1 land at the designated point, they meet 5 individuals, who control the replicators. The others reveal that they are an evolution of the replicators - composed of micro-cellular replicator blocks, and modeled on Reese, who created the original replicators. These others have reset the time machine so that time is moving more quickly within this area of space - to allow them to evolve and build an enormous army that can invade the rest of space. The minds of the team are probed by the first 4 others. However, the last member of the others (called Fifth) seems reluctant - he is described as weak by First, the leader of the replicators. He was an attempt to model Reese more fully, but the mistake will not be repeated. Carter senses his reluctance to probe her mind, but invites him to do so - and they agree a plan. Fifth will reset the time dilation machine to run slowly, and he will escape with the SG team. While time is passing slowly for his brethren, the Asguard will have hundreds of years to fix the mistake in the others. Fifth has to leave later than the SG team to avoid arousing the suspicion of the others; Jack orders Carter to set the timer on the device to activate earlier than Fifth has been told. SG-1 escape successfully as the time dilation device reverses the trend within the area of space, and makes time run much more slowly. However, Fifth is caught by his brethren, and realises that Carter had broken her promise not to leave without him. Carter and Jonas regret using Fifth's humanity against him, but even though Jack seems uncomfortable, he declares that Fifth wasn't human, and they made the only correct choice. \r\n"

With the help of Daniel, Jonas and Carter find a secret chamber where the eye is kept but not before O'Neill, Teal'c, Skaara, and a group of defenders are overrun and trapped inside the pyramid housing the stargate. But Daniel also finds a tablet, written in ancient, suggesting that there is an Ancient city, lost for thousands of years, that give Earth weapons with which to defeat Anubis. But the only way to get the tablet back to Earth for further translation and for the search for the lost city may be Daniel breaking the high rule of ascension and to destroy Anubis. If he doesn't, Abydos will be destroyed. \r\n"

                "Revolving around Truvy's Beauty Parlor in a small parish in modern-day Louisiana, STEEL MAGNOLIAS is the story of a close-knit circle of friends whose lives come together there. As the picture opens, we find Drum Eatenton shooting birds in the trees of his back yard in preparation for his daughter's wedding reception that afternoon. Shortly thereafter, M'Lynn and Shelby (Drum's wife and daughter) depart for Truvy's to get their hair done for the wedding. \"Just the sweetest thing,\" Annelle Depuy Desoto (who may or may not be married because her marriage may not be legal) is introduced to Truvy's customers as her new \"glamour technician.\" While in the chairs, the sour-tempered Ouiser Boudreaux shows up and entertains the assemblage with her barbs. It seems that the only one of the group who truly understands Ouiser is Clairee who is recently widowed and looking for a diversion. As she says, later in the picture, \"If you can't find anything good to say about anybody, come sit by me.\" Filled with humor and heartbreak, these \"Steel Magnolias\" make us laugh and cry as the realities of their lives in tiny Chiquapin Parish unfolds.\r\n\r\nSally Field ....

Suddenly, a huge, mysterious, veg-ravaging \"beast\" begins attacking the town's sacred vegetable plots at night, and the competition hostess, Lady Tottington, commissions Anti-Pesto to catch it and save the day. Lying in wait, however, is Lady Tottington's snobby suitor, Victor Quartermaine, who'd rather shoot the beast and secure the position of local hero-not to mention Lady Tottingon's hand in marriage. With the fate of the competition in the balance, Lady Tottington is eventually forced to allow Victor to hunt down the vegetable chomping marauder.

She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer, named Kenneth. Together they find shelter in a mall along with a group of other survivors. For a while everything is ok, but pretty soon, they start running out of food, the power goes out, and the dead keep finding ways to break through their defenses. Realizing they're sitting ducks, they make a plan to head for an island by using two armored mall shuttle busses to get across the sea of zombies.\r\n\r\n\r\n Sarah Polley ....

                "Two men wake up at opposite sides of a dirty, disused bathroom, chained by their ankles to pipes. Between them lies a dead man loosely clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun. Each finds a tape the perfect fit for the player in their back pocket. They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die. They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralyzed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open. She survives, but her cell mate doesn't. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of more victims, and of the nearly-successful capture of the Jigsaw Killer, who doesn't actually kill his victims. Instead, he finds ways to make them kill either themselves, or each other, and he thinks the entire 'game' out perfectly, with no other ways out. Or so it would seem\r\n\r\n\r\n Leigh Whannell ....

In this horror flick, the murderous serial killer, Charles Lee Ray, has his body parts being held at a criminal evidence station in the form of a small doll known as the famous Chucky. When his old-time sweet heart, Tiffany, picks up his remaining limbs and puts them back together, she performs a ritual that revives the murderous maniac. But Chucky decides that he wants another individual to help him with his dirty work. So he kills Tiffany, and then revives her as a \"doll bride\". When they decide to spend their honeymoon with another happy couple on the highway, it becomes another murder spree. With a \"blood-bath on wheels\" and two murderous dolls, the human couples find that this was going to be a \"Highway To Hell\" in this gruesome film of blood and gore and a little bit of Chucky & Tiffany.\r\n\r\nJennifer Tilly ....

                "The killer doll is back! The all-new film is the fifth in the popular series of Chucky (\"Child's Play\") horror comedies. Making his directorial debut is the franchise creator and writer of all five films, Don Mancini. The film introduces Glen (voiced by \"The Lord of the Rings\" star Billy Boyd), the orphan doll offspring of the irrepressible devilish-doll-come-to-life Chucky (again voiced by series star Brad Dourif) and his equally twisted bride Tiffany (again voiced by Jennifer Tilly). When production starts on a movie detailing the urban legend of his parents' lethal exploits, Glen heads for Hollywood where he brings his bloodthirsty parents back from the dead. The family dynamics are far from perfect as Chucky and Tiffany go Hollywood and get rolling on a new spree of murderous mayhem; much to gentle Glen's horror. Chucky can't believe that his child doesn't want to walk in his murdering footsteps, and star-struck Tiffany can't believe that the movie will star her favorite actress, Jennifer Tilly (playing herself), who soon becomes an unwitting hostess to this new family in more ways than one...\r\n\r\nBrad Dourif ....

Once inside, the team finds the remains of humans with holes in the rib cage and the remains of facehuggers, meaning that the possibility of the temple being uninhabited is very unlikely. To make matters worse, a group of teenage Predators are coming to the temple to perform a coming-of-age ritual that involves fighting to the death with the aliens.

The next day, biology teacher Dr. Ira Kane and geology teacher Harry Block from Glen Canyon Community College manage to get to the meteorite, which is stuck in the ground at the bottom of a cave. By taking a sample, they discover a slimy blue fluid coming out of the meteorite.

What first seems like a sure ticket to Sweden for the Nobel Prize soon develops into a nightmare: By evolving and adapting at that unbelievably fast rate, the Aliens start spreading out, and the Military comes in.

                "This film, adapted from a work of fiction by author Tracy Chevalier, tells a story about the events surrounding the creation of the painting \"Girl With A Pearl Earring\" by 17th century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. Little is known about the girl in the painting, it is speculated that she was a maid who lived in the house of the painter along with his family and other servants, though there is no historical evidence . This masterful film attempts to recreate the mysterious girl's life. Griet, played by Scarlett Johansson, is a maid in the house of painter Johannes Vermeer, played by British actor Colin Firth. Vermeer's wealthy patron and sole means of support, Van Ruijven, commissions him to paint Griet with the intent that he will have her for himself before it is finished. She must somehow secretly pose for the crucial painting without the knowledge of Vermeer's wife, avoid Van Ruijven's grasp, and protect herself from the cruel gossip of the world of a 17th century servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n Colin Firth ....

                "Coming of age: Heidi, 15, runs away from home after her mom sees her kissing mom's boyfriend. She goes to a Snowy River resort where a vague job offer doesn't pan out. She manages to find a place to live and a job at a convenience store. She's between childhood -- nursery rimes and a scrapbook of glittery unicorns - and adulthood - working, sorting out emotions and sexuality, and dealing with social slights and false charges of bad behavior. She's attractive and her loneliness makes her vulnerable. She sleeps with Joe, the son of local ranchers, and she awakens in him feelings he can't express. Is there any way she can put off adulthood and be a kid awhile longer?\r\n\r\nAbbie Cornish ...  Heidi \r\n Sam Worthington ...  Joe \r\n Lynette Curran ...  Irene \r\n Nathaniel Dean ...

Tyler Gage is a rebel from the wrong side of Baltimore¹s tracks ­ and the only thing that stands between him and an unfulfilled life are his dreams of one day making it out of there. Nora is a privileged ballet dancer attending Baltimore¹s ultra-elite Maryland School of the Arts -- and the only thing standing in the way of her obviously brilliant future is finding a great dance partner for her senior showcase. When trouble with the law lands Tyler with a community service gig at Maryland School of the Arts, he arrives as an angry outsider, until his skills as a gifted street dancer draw Nora¹s attention.

                "The town of Auburn was always normal, to say the least. True, the people there weren't really a \"community\", but they never noticed...until a stranger named Joshua rolled into town one morning. In small ways, Joshua began to help out around the town-helping a teen play guitar, helping save a marriage in danger, or teaching a bumbling priest how to speak about faith. An old Baptist church that came down in a storm is his next big project. With the help of stuttering Theo, who dreams of being a preacher, he brings the town together to restore the old building. In this way, the whole town unites and becomes a community. This attracts the attention of Father Tordone, who is a bitter man due to the fact that he lost a position in the Vatican. When the mysterious Joshua begins to show up in two places at once and miraculously cures a blind woman, Father Tordone believes Joshua is a false prophet, trying to cheat people. When his next huge miracle-reviving Theo from death after he falls from the roof of the newly completed church-overwhelms the town, Father Tordone seeks out an official condemnation from the Vatican. But Joshua melts his icy heart, and the reformed Father becomes a Vatican member. Joshua sees the Pope himself and reveals himself as Jesus! After his meeting, Joshua leaves-but the people of Auburn, with their dreams fufilled and their happiness increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n Tony Goldwyn ...  Joshua \r\n F. Murray Abraham ...

However, a series of random terrorist attacks perpetrated by cyborgs and humans alike threaten to throw Olympus into total chaos. As it turns out, these humans and machines have come under the influence of an unknown electronic signal that hacks into their nervous systems and they then become the unwilling servants of a malevolent computerized entity.

I am huge fan of anime and most importantly of the final fantasy series and to see someone have the balls to pull off this sort of genre is a statement in itself. Unfortunately we do get the bad apples like \"ultraviolet\". The overall story is comprehensible to a certain point, only real problem I see was there was not enough back story to support what is going on. It's like being kidnapped and strapped onto a roller-coaster with a blind fold on, you know what's going on around you but you're not exactly sure how you even got there in the first place.\r\n\r\nTak Sakaguchi ...

Thirteen years later, in the middle of political and economical problems, Charles II asks the return of his friend John Wilmot, aka the second Earl of Rochester, from the exile to London. John is a morally corrupt, drunkard and sexually active cynical poet, and the King asks him to prepare a play for the French ambassador to make him pleased. John meets the aspirant actress Elizabeth Barry in the playhouse and decides to make her a great star. He falls in love for her, and she becomes his mistress; during the presentation to the Frenchman, he falls in disgrace in the court.

In the waiting room of an abortion clinic, the quirky and whip-sharp Juno decides to give birth and to place the child with an adoptive couple. She finds one in the PennySaver personals, contacts them, tells her dad and step-mother, and carries on with school.

                "In a future of political, economic and moral collapse, a genetically enhanced superhuman prototype named Max escapes from military confines and dwells amidst the decadent underground street life of *Seattle* to avoid government agents who want to bring her back into the fold. Searching for others of her kind who were scattered in the aftermath of her escape, Max encounters Logan, an idealistic cyber-journalist battling repression and corruption in post-apocalypse America. Eventually, Logan calls her to the highest part of her being and Max becomes his samurai as the pair takes on the ruthless power-brokers of the new millennium. Max and Logan's odyssey leads them closer to the secret of her past, deepening and complicating their relationship in the process.\r\n\r\nJames Cameron's Dark Angel\r\n\r\nSeries Directed by \r\nJeff Woolnough   (6 episodes, 2001-2002) \r\nJoe Ann Fogle   (2 episodes, 2000-2001) \r\nMichael Katleman   (2 episodes, 2000-2001) \r\nPaul Shapiro   (2 episodes, 2000-2001) \r\nAllan Kroeker   (2 episodes, 2001-2002) \r\nStephen Williams   (2 episodes, 2002) \r\n\r\n \r\nMorgan Beggs   (unknown episodes) \r\nKenneth Biller   (unknown episodes) \r\nLes Landau   (unknown episodes) \r\nBryan Spicer   (unknown episodes) \r\nDavid Straiton   (unknown episodes) \r\n  \r\nSeries Writing credits \r\nJames Cameron   (42 episodes, 2000-2002) \r\nCharles H.

Mom and Dad don't hesitate to sit down and dig in, but Chihiro senses danger and refuses.

With the complete cooperation of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, Altman follows the stories of the dancers, whose professional and personal lives grow impossibly close, as they cope with the demands of a life in the ballet.

Brokering the incident for political capital, Shaw eventually becomes a vice-presidential nominee, while Marco is haunted by dreams of what happened -- or didn't happen -- in Kuwait. As Marco (now a Major) investigates, the story begins to unravel, to the point where he questions if it happened at all. Is it possible the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed to believe Shaw is a war hero as part of a plot to seize the White House? Some very powerful people at Manchurian Global corporation appear desperate to stop him from finding out. \r\n\r\nDirected by \r\nJonathan Demme    \r\n  \r\nWriting credits\r\n(WGA) \r\nRichard Condon   (novel)\r\nGeorge Axelrod   (1962 screenplay)\r\nDaniel Pyne   (screenplay) and  \r\nDean Georgaris   (screenplay) \r\n\r\nJeffrey Wright ...

She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica (Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.\r\n\r\nDirected by \r\nDarren Aronofsky    \r\n  \r\nWriting credits\r\n(WGA) \r\nMark Heyman   (screenplay) and  \r\nAndres Heinz   (screenplay) (as Andrés Heinz) and  \r\nJohn J.

                "\"Watchmen\" is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the \"Doomsday Clock\" - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity... but who is watching the Watchmen?\"\r\n\r\nDirected by \r\nZack Snyder    \r\n  \r\nWriting credits\r\n(WGA) \r\nDavid Hayter   (screenplay) and  \r\nAlex Tse   (screenplay)\r\nDave Gibbons   (graphic novel illustrator)\r\nAlan Moore   (graphic novel) uncredited\r\n\r\nMalin Akerman ...

                "In 1982, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population, nicknamed \"The Prawns,\" appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.\r\n\r\nSharlto Copley  ...  Wikus Van De Merwe  \r\n  Jason Cope  ...

A traveling vendor rolls through the forest in his old wagon. A woman from every village on his route faithfully awaits him. He's attractive, intelligent, charming.... But he's also the monster feared by all. His most recent prey, Barbara will soon become the one who hunts him down. The film is based on the true-life story of Manuel Blanco Romasanta, the traveling vendor, who confessed to the murders of thirteen people, using their body fat to make soap. Romasanta was tried in Allaríz in 1852 and avoided capital punishment by proclaiming he was a werewolf. Barbara was the lone survivor of four sisters.\r\n\r\nJulian Sands  ...

After losing her childhood farm to the bank, local beauty Rene decides to leave town and head for the big city. Suddenly, an avalanche of meteorites races through the sky, bombarding the town and bringing an otherworldly infection. Departing is going to be much more difficult than she had planned.

Yet again Nature is doing something inexplicable, and whatever science has to say about it will be, in the end, only a theory. Scientists will bring out more theories, but no explanations, when a more urgent dilemma hits the planet. It begins in Central Park. Suddenly and inexplicably, the behavior of everyone in the park changes in a most bizarre and horrible way. Soon, the strange behavior spreads throughout the city and beyond. Elliot, his wife, Alma, and Jess, the young daughter of a friend, will only have theories to guide them where to run and where to hide. But theories may not be enough.\r\n\r\nDirected by\t\t\t\r\nM.

                "In New York, the former NYPD detective Ben Carson is hired to work as night watch of the remains of the Mayflower Department Store that was partially destroyed by fire many years ago. Ben became alcoholic and was retired from the police force after killing a man in a shooting. His marriage was also destroyed and now he is living in the apartment of his younger sister Angie. However he has not been drinking for three months and sees the employment as a chance to rebuild his life. When he goes to the rounds in his first night, he finds that the mirrors are impeccably clean and his colleague explains that the former night watch was obsessed by the mirrors. After a couple of nights, Ben sees weird images in the mirrors, but due to the lack of credibility of his past, his ex-wife Amy believes he has hallucinations as a side effect of his medication.

                "Colter Stevens, a US Army helicopter pilot whose last memory is flying in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train. However, he discovers that he has assumed the identity of another man. 8 minutes later, the train explodes and Stevens finds himself in some kind of pod. He then talks to someone named Goodwin, who tells him he has to go back and find out who the bomber is. He is sent back to go through the whole thing again and attempts to find who the bomber is but fails. The bomb goes off and Stevens finds himself in the pod again. He is sent back another time, yet still cannot find out anything. When he returns, he asks what is going on. Goodwin and Rutledge, the scientist in charge, tell him that he is part of a project that can put someone in another person's consciousness during the last 8 minutes of their life. Stevens then asks why he cannot just stop the bomb. He is told that he is not going back in time but placed in the moment so he can find out who the bomber is and if there are any other targets. On the side, Stevens finds himself falling for the woman traveling with him while he is still in the other man's consciousness\r\n\r\nDirected by\t\t\t\r\nDuncan Jones\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nWriting credits\t\t\t\r\n(WGA)\t\t\t\r\nBen Ripley\t\t(written by\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal...Colter Stevens\r\nMichelle Monaghan...Christina Warren\r\nVera Farmiga...Colleen Goodwin\r\nJeffrey Wright...Dr. Rutledge\r\nMichael Arden...Derek Frost\r\nCas Anvar...Hazmi\r\nRussell Peters...Max Denoff\r\nBrent Skagford...George Troxel\r\nCraig Thomas...Gold Watch Executive\r\nGordon Masten...Conductor\r\nSusan Bain...Nurse\r\nPaula Jean Hixson...Coffee Mug Lady\r\nLincoln Ward...Minister Sudoku\r\nKyle Gatehouse...College Student\r\nAlbert Kwan...Soda Can Guy"

Neo himself has discovered his superpowers including super speed, ability to see the codes of the things inside the matrix and a certain degree of pre-cognition. But a nasty piece of news hits the human resistance: 250,000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would reach them in 72 hours. As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source.

                "Several months have passed since The X-Men defeated Magneto and imprisoned him in a seemingly impregnable plastic chamber. One day, a mutant by the name of Nightcrawler infiltrates the White House and attempts to assassinate the president, setting off a chain reaction of anti-mutant measures by the government. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to discover his past. As scientist named William Stryker discovers Professor X's secret school and Cerebro, Magneto's partner, Mystique, is planning to break her leader out of prison. But when Professor X's school is attacked by Stryker's forces, Logan, Rogue, Iceman and a few are lucky to escape. Those who remain meet in Boston, where they form an uneasy alliance with Magneto to stop Stryker and rescue Professor X.\r\n\r\nPatrick Stewart...Professor Charles Xavier\r\nHugh Jackman...Logan/Wolverine\r\nIan McKellen...Eric Lensherr/Magneto\r\nHalle Berry...Ororo Munroe/Storm\r\nFamke Janssen...Jean Grey\r\nJames Marsden...Scott Summers/Cyclops\r\nAnna Paquin...Marie/Rogue\r\nRebecca Romijn...Raven Darkholme/Mystique\r\n(as Rebecca Romijn-Stamos)\r\nBrian Cox...William Stryker\r\nAlan Cumming...Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler\r\nBruce Davison...Senator Kelly\r\nAaron Stanford...John Allerdyce/Pyro\r\nShawn Ashmore...Bobby Drake/Iceman\r\nKelly Hu...Yuriko Oyama/Lady Deathstrike\r\nKatie Stuart...Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Bryan Singer \r\n\r\nWriting credits (WGA)\r\nZak Penn(story) and \r\nDavid Hayter(story) & \r\nBryan Singer(story)\r\n\r\nMichael Dougherty(screenplay) & \r\nDan Harris(screenplay) and \r\nDavid Hayter(screenplay)\r\n\r\n   "

                "The indoctrination of Gerrit Wolfaardt is complete: his family traditions, history, culture- even his church-have taught him that black South Africans are a cancer in the land. Under the eye of prominent members of the government and military, Gerrit develops a diabolical plan to rid South Africa of its \"black danger.\" Before his plans can be carried out, he meets two people who will put him on a collision course with his future: Celeste, an open-minded University student, and Peter Lekota, a pastor who challenges Gerrit's prejudice. His \"final solution\" meets its greatest obstacle when Gerrit realizes he is wrong. The Persecutor becomes the Peacemaker and begins to seek reconciliation between whites and blacks. However, in the turbulent last days of apartheid, there are those who doubt his transformation. One such person is Moses Moremi, whom Gerrit had once violently attacked. In the end, it is Moses who must choose between peace and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Kani...Rev.

His primary job responsibility is to harvest and periodically rocket back to Earth supplies of helium-3, the current clean and abundant fuel used on Earth. There is no direct communication link available between the lunar station and Earth, so his only direct real-time interaction is with GERTY, the intelligent computer whose function is to attend to his day to day needs. With such little human contact and all of it indirect, he feels that three years is far too long to be so isolated; he knows he is beginning to hallucinate as the end of his three years approaches. All he wants is to return to Earth to be with his wife Tess and their infant daughter Eve, who was born just prior to his leaving for this job. With two weeks to go, he gets into an accident at one of the mechanical harvesters and is rendered unconscious...\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Rockwell...Sam Bell\r\nKevin Spacey...GERTY(voice)\r\nDominique McElligott...Tess Bell\r\nRosie Shaw...Little Eve\r\nAdrienne Shaw...Nanny\r\nKaya Scodelario...Eve\r\nBenedict Wong...Thompson\r\nMatt Berry...Overmeyers\r\nMalcolm Stewart...Technician\r\nRobin Chalk...Sam Bell Clone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Duncan Jones \r\n\r\nWriting credits\r\nDuncan Jones(story)\r\n\r\nNathan Parker(written by)\r\n\r\n   "

He also notices that his 17-year old daughter, from another marriage, has probably been crying. What's up?

Is it a plot by the government to suppress the opposition, or have our terrorist enemies secretly gained control of our security system and are now using it against us? Following another major terrorist attack the US instigates an intense government surveillance program in which every camera in the country is linked into a single, all-seeing network called the ODIN system (for Optical Defense Intelligence Network). The system includes millions of mobile, robotic surveillance cameras known as \"Eyeborgs,\" which watch everyone for suspicious behavior, all in the name of security, law enforcement and keeping America safe.

                "In 1974 Samuel Joseph Byck attempted to hijack a plane he intended to fly into the White House to kill Richard Nixon - possibly the first time an airliner was to be used as a flying bomb in a terrorist attack. Sam Bicke is a lonely, ineffectual incompetent who feels wronged by his family, friends, employers and the world in general, though his problems are largely of his own making and his petulant refusal to compromise what he sees as his 'values'. Thus he loses his job rather than 'lie' to customers about prices, while at the same time he continuously deceives his friends, and steals from his friend and his brother. Elaborate plans for success founder on equally avoidable issues. As his world falls apart, he fantasizes Richard Nixon (then under the shadow of Watergate and soon to leave office) as his ultimate enemy, and Leonard Bernstein (to whom he dictates endless self-exculpatory audio letters) as his only friend and equal...\r\n\r\n\r\nSean Penn...Samuel J.

He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio...Teddy Daniels\r\nMark Ruffalo...Chuck Aule\r\nBen Kingsley...Dr. Cawley\r\nMax von Sydow...Dr. Naehring(as Max Von Sydow)\r\nMichelle Williams...Dolores\r\nEmily Mortimer...Rachel 1\r\nPatricia Clarkson...Rachel 2\r\nJackie Earle Haley...George Noyce\r\nTed Levine...Warden\r\nJohn Carroll Lynch...Deputy Warden McPherson\r\nElias Koteas...Laeddis\r\nRobin Bartlett...Bridget Kearns\r\nChristopher Denham...Peter Breene\r\nNellie Sciutto...Nurse Marino\r\nJoseph Sikora...Glen Miga(as Joe Sikora)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Martin Scorsese \r\n\r\nWriting credits (WGA)\r\nLaeta Kalogridis(screenplay)\r\n\r\nDennis Lehane(novel)\r\n\r\n   "

For three years after being forced from office, Nixon remained silent. But in summer 1977, the steely, cunning former commander-in-chief agreed to sit for one all-inclusive interview to confront the questions of his time in office and the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency. Nixon surprised everyone in selecting Frost as his televised confessor, intending to easily outfox the breezy British showman and secure a place in the hearts and minds of Americans (as well as a $600,000 fee). Likewise, Frost's team harbored doubts about their boss' ability to hold his own. But as cameras rolled, a charged battle of wits resulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Langella...Richard Nixon\r\nMichael Sheen...David Frost\r\nSam Rockwell...James Reston, Jr.\r\nKevin Bacon...Jack Brennan\r\nMatthew Macfadyen...John Birt\r\nOliver Platt...Bob Zelnick\r\nRebecca Hall...Caroline Cushing\r\nToby Jones...Swifty Lazar\r\nAndy Milder...Frank Gannon\r\nKate Jennings Grant...Diane Sawyer\r\nGabriel Jarret...Ken Khachigian\r\nJim Meskimen...Ray Price\r\nPatty McCormack...Pat Nixon\r\nGeoffrey Blake...Interview Director\r\nClint Howard...Lloyd Davis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Ron Howard \r\n\r\nWriting credits\r\nPeter Morgan(screenplay)\r\n\r\nPeter Morgan(play)\r\n\r\n   "

To get it, he must pursue across, under and through the streets of modern-day New York the only woman he's ever loved.

Scott Summers (Cyclops) is still grieving about her loss. One day, he came out to the place which is where Jean Gray sacrificed herself. Then, Jean Gray appeared right in front of him. Though, it seemed that after that, Scott had disappeared. Meanwhille, the rift between humans and mutants had finally reached the boiling point. When humans discovered what causes humans to mutate, they have found a cure for the mutation. The X-Men were appalled at this idea. It was not long at all until the news about the cure came to Magneto. He decides to organize an army of mutants and wage his war against the humans. Then, it became clear that Jean Gray evolved into the Pheonix, her new mutant powers are so strong that she can not control her own body...\r\n\r\n\r\nHugh Jackman...Logan/ Wolverine\r\nHalle Berry...Ororo Munroe/ Storm\r\nIan McKellen...Eric Lehnsherr/ Magneto\r\nPatrick Stewart...Charles Xavier/ Professor X\r\nFamke Janssen...Jean Grey/ Phoenix\r\nAnna Paquin...Marie/ Rogue\r\nKelsey Grammer...Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy/ Beast\r\nJames Marsden...Scott Summers/ Cyclops\r\nRebecca Romijn...Raven Darkholme/ Mystique\r\nShawn Ashmore...Bobby Drake/ Iceman\r\nAaron Stanford...John Allerdyce/ Pyro\r\nVinnie Jones...Cain Marko/ Juggernaut\r\nEllen Page...Kitty Pryde/ Shadowcat\r\nDaniel Cudmore...Peter Rasputin/ Colossus\r\nBen Foster...Warren Worthington III/ Angel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Brett Ratner \r\n\r\nWriting credits (WGA)\r\nSimon Kinberg(written by) & \r\nZak Penn(written by)\r\n\r\n   "

They left behind their clothes, their money, all of their essentials. Even their dogs were abandoned, tied to posts and left to starve. No One knows why. A search party dispatched by the U.S. Army eventually discovered the remains of nearly 300 of Friar's evacuees. Many had frozen to death. Others were cruelly and mysteriously slaughtered. The bodies of the remaining citizens are still unaccounted for. Over the years, a quiet cover-up operation managed to weave the story of Friar into the stuff of legends and backwoods fairy tales. The town has slowly repopulated, but the vast wilderness is mostly untracked, with the northern-most stretches off limits to local hunters and loggers. In 2008, the coordinates for the \"YELLOWBRICKROAD\" trail head were declassified...\r\n\r\n\r\nCassidy Freeman...Erin Luger\r\nAnessa Ramsey...Melissa Barnes\r\nClark Freeman...Daryl Luger\r\nLaura Heisler...Liv McCann\r\nLee Wilkof...Clerk/ Usher\r\nTara Giordano...Jill\r\nMichael Laurino...Teddy Barnes\r\nAlex Draper...Walter Myrick\r\nSam Elmore...Cy Banbridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Jesse Holland \r\n Andy Mitton \r\n\r\nWriting credits (in alphabetical order) \r\nJesse Holland written by\r\nAndy Mitton written by\r\n\r\n   "

                "July, 1995, the time is out of joint. Two teen girls, Sam and Corey, have left Virginia for L.A. to start over. Sam's brother has died and her family's shattered; Corey's too wild. They have car trouble in a small desert town, where Corey immediately starts her partying ways, where a meteorite strikes a windmill, and where a burned-out Desert Storm vet predicts the end of the world in four days. Sam hallucinates while sleepwalking, young men have disappeared from town, and cars come out of nowhere to cause accidents. Time travel may be possible, but it takes courage and resolve. Is the addled war veteran right? If he is, can Corey or Sam make things right?\r\n\r\n\r\nDaveigh Chase...Samantha\r\nBriana Evigan...Corey\r\nJames Lafferty...Iraq Jack\r\nEd Westwick...Randy\r\nWalter Platz...Frank\r\nJohn Hawkes...Phil\r\nBret Roberts...Officer O'Dell\r\nJackson Rathbone...Jeremy\r\nElizabeth Berkley...Trudy\r\nBarbara Tarbuck...Agatha\r\nMatthew Davis...Pastor John\r\nNathan Stevens...Jeff\r\nRyan Templeman...Mike\r\nZulay Henao...Baelyn\r\nJJ Neward...Co-Worker(as J.J.

We know this from a glimpse of a license plate, the craftsman architecture of the two houses, and the mature, rich landscapes in between. The setting, like the scrutiny of the four main character's lives, is defined by the narrowness of the camera's field-of view. The one commercial street in town is only seen in the reflection of a store window, a shot of a non-descript auto-yard, or the tunnel of a tree-lined suburban sidewalk. The lush, wooded landscape is understood as an immediate presence in the domestic and professional lives of the characters; a steep hill, railroad tracks, a rushing stream, and a path over an old steel bridge are revisited again and again by the characters in their capacities as lovers, parents and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Ruffalo...Jack Linden\r\nLaura Dern...Terry Linden\r\nPeter Krause...Hank Evans\r\nNaomi Watts...Edith Evans\r\nSam Charles...Sean Linden\r\nGinger Broatch...Natasha Linden(as Haili Page)\r\nJennifer Bishop...Sharon Evans\r\nJennifer Mawhinney...Audrey\r\nAmber Rothwell...Lauren\r\nMeg Roe...Lollipop Girl\r\nJim Francis...Joe Ritchie\r\nMarc Baur...Plumber\r\nPatrick Earley...Jim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n John Curran \r\n\r\nWriting credits (WGA)\r\nAndre Dubus(short stories \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\" and \"Adultery\")\r\n\r\nLarry Gross(screenplay)\r\n\r\n   "

A fifth girl, plump and insecure, agrees, but they end up making out under the bleachers. When a group of school bullies catches them, the girl claims that Jeremy attacked her.

He and his expedition discover the remnants of the once dominant civilization living on a subsistence level in caves. Long ago their advanced society had become so complacent that they built a super-computer to run and maintain the machines that supported their indolent, self-indulgent lifestyle. After the machines were destroyed by a meteor shower, the inhabitants found themselves without the knowledge to rebuild them, completely subservient to the computer whose megalomania was now unchallenged. The cruel cyber-despot reveals that it arranged for ship's landing because it needs the skills of the Earthlings to make critical repairs in its damaged circuitry. When the computer announces future plans for the conquest of the Universe, the captain and his crew know it is time to act.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Richardson...Mike Hamilton\r\nYanti Somer...Diana Greene\r\nGaetano Balestrieri...Vassilov\r\nNicolas Barthe...Connolly\r\nMassimo Bonetti\r\nAldo Canti...Frank Bimble\r\nOmero Capanna\r\nRomeo Costantini\r\nMassimo De Cecco\r\nDaniele Dublino\r\nGiuseppe Fortis\r\nManfred Freyberger\r\nMarco Gelardini\r\nEnrico Gozzo\r\nVassili Karis...Svensson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Alfonso Brescia (as Al Bradley)\r\n\r\nWriting credits (in alphabetical order) \r\nAlfonso Brescia (as Al Bradley)\r\nAldo Crudo (as Al Crydo)\r\nMassimo Lo Jacono\r\nGiacomo Mazzocchi\r\n\r\n   "

He arrives to the crime scene in a parking area with Officer Jacob Reed and their investigation discloses that the victim had left a tavern with a gorgeous woman and apparently had been trampled by a heavy animal in the truck cabin. Later, two other bodies of men arrive in the morgue in the same conditions, and the coroner Dana notes that all of them had erection in the moment of death, and Dwight notes hooves in the body. Dana investigates further and finds deer footprints and hair in the corpses. When Dwight and Reed talks to an Indian descendent in a casino, they unravel a Pohancan legend about a deer woman, half woman but having deer hooves and trampling men after seducing them. Without any other lead, they begin to believe that every legend is based on facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter High...Pool Player\r\nMichael P.

While on Earth, they kidnap two lively children that lead the group of Martians to the North Pole and Santa. The Martians then take Santa and the two children back to Mars with them. Voldar, a particularly grumpy Martian, attempts to do away with the children and Santa before they get to Mars, but their leader Lomas stops him.

They travel by ship where Ellen meets and becomes involved with Lord John Brindale. This causes her to miss a rehearsal. Tom (Astaire) uses the time to dance with a hat rack and gym equipment. Later Tom and Ellen attempt a graceful dance number as the ship rolls. Upon arrival Tom holds auditions and meets Sara. There is much indecision by the siblings about their romantic partners even though they are in-the-clouds. Tom dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room. All ends well in this light musical. By the way, there is a vaudeville-style dance number in their show that features slapstick.

When the boat, which was en route to another port, is temporarily stranded on the island due to a possible Cholera outbreak on-board, Sadie spends her time \"partying\" with the American soldiers stationed on the island. Her behavior, however, is more than the Davidsons can stand and soon Mr. Davidson confronts Sadie about her evil ways and offers salvation. When Sadie rebels and the attempted redemption does not go as planned, Davidson arranges to have her sent back to San Francisco, where she fled some years ago due to mysterious personal issues.

                "Hanna (Ronan) is a teenage girl. Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier; these come from being raised by her father (Bana), an ex-CIA man, in the wilds of Finland. Living a life unlike any other teenager, her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin. The turning point in her adolescence is a sharp one; sent into the world by her father on a mission, Hanna journeys stealthily across Europe while eluding agents dispatched after her by a ruthless intelligence operative with secrets of her own (Blanchett). As she nears her ultimate target, Hanna faces startling revelations about her existence and unexpected questions about her humanity.                \r\n\r\n\r\nSaoirse Ronan...Hanna \r\nEric Bana...Erik Heller \r\nVicky Krieps...Johanna Zadek \r\nCate Blanchett...Marissa Wiegler \r\nParis Arrowsmith...CIA Tech #1 \r\nJohn Macmillan...Lewis \r\nTim Beckmann...Walt \r\nPaul Birchard...Bob \r\nChristian Malcolm...Head of Ops \r\nJamie Beamish...Burton \r\nTom Hodgkins...Monitor \r\nVincent Montuel...Camp G Doctor #1 \r\nNathan Nolan...Camp G Doctor #2 \r\nMichelle Dockery...False Marissa \r\nJessica Barden...Sophie \r\n\r\n\r\nDirected byJoe Wright\r\n        Writing CreditsSeth Lochhead...(screenplay) and\r\n  David Farr...(screenplay)\r\n  \r\nSeth Lochhead...(story)\r\n  "

                "In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet-or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets.

But as Joe and Claire prepare to open a bottle of champagne, their idyll comes to an abrupt end. A hot air balloon drifts into the field, obviously in trouble. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down. Joe and three other men rush to secure the basket. Just as they secure the balloon, the wind rushes into the field, and at once the rescuers are airborne. Joe manages to drop to the ground, as do most of his companions, but one man is lifted skywards. As Joe, Claire and the other rescuers watch this strangely beautiful sight, they see the man fall to his death. Recalling the day's events at dinner with his friends Robin and Rachel, Joe reveals the impact the accident has had on his battered psyche.

Oliver is naturally a sullen man due to his growing up relationship with his parents (his mother who had a unique view on life) and watching his parents' cordial but somewhat distant relationship with each other, but is more so now because of his personal family loss. Oliver embarks on a relationship with Anna, a French actress. Oliver is hoping that his re-energized relationship with Hal following Georgia's death and Hal's new outlook on life during that time will show Oliver how to act in a loving relationship. After Georgia's death, Hal came out of the closet and began to live with a joie de vivre that did not exist before, which included an open relationship with a much younger man named Andy.

                "In the early 1960's, sixteen year old Jenny Mellor lives with her parents in the London suburb of Twickenham. On her father's wishes, everything that Jenny does is in the sole pursuit of being accepted into Oxford, as he wants her to have a better life than he. Jenny is bright, pretty, hard working but also naturally gifted. The only problems her father may perceive in her life is her issue with learning Latin, and her dating a boy named Graham, who is nice but socially awkward. Jenny's life changes after she meets David Goldman, a man over twice her age. David goes out of his way to show Jenny and her family that his interest in her is not improper and that he wants solely to expose her to cultural activities which she enjoys. Jenny quickly gets accustomed to the life to which David and his constant companions, Danny and Helen, have shown her, and Jenny and David's relationship does move into becoming a romantic one. However, Jenny slowly learns more about David, and by association ...                \r\n\r\n\r\nCarey Mulligan...Jenny Mellor \r\nOlivia Williams...Miss Stubbs \r\nAlfred Molina...Jack Mellor \r\nCara Seymour...Marjorie \r\nWilliam Melling...Small Boy #1 \r\nConnor Catchpole...Small Boy #2 \r\nMatthew Beard...Graham \r\nPeter Sarsgaard...David Goldman \r\nAmanda Fairbank-Hynes...Hattie \r\nEllie Kendrick...Tina \r\nDominic Cooper...Danny \r\nRosamund Pike...Helen \r\nNick Sampson...Auctioneer \r\nKate Duchêne...Latin Teacher (as Kate Duchene)\r\nBel Parker...Small Girl \r\n\r\n\r\nDirected byLone Scherfig\r\n        Writing Credits(in alphabetical order)Lynn Barber...(memoir)\r\n  Nick Hornby...(screenplay)\r\n  "

Molly was a promising composer and piano player when she was a girl, and now she is a twenty-three year-old insecure woman that feels stuck in her job. Among the costumers of the Emporium is the lonely hat collector, Eric Applebaum, who has only Molly and Mr. Magorium for friends. When the last pair of shoes that Mr. Magorium bought in Toscana is worn, he hires the accountant, Henry Weston to adjust the accounts of the Emporium. Furthermore, he claims that he is two hundred and forty-three years old and his time to go has come; he gives a block of wood called Congreve cube to Molly and asks Henry to transfer the Emporium to her name.

Joe Warr throws himself into the only child-rearing philosophy he thinks has a shot at bringing joy back into their lives: \"just says yes.\" Raising two boys - a curious six year-old and a rebel teen from a previous marriage -- in a household devoid of feminine influence, and with a lack of rules, life becomes exuberant, instinctual, reckless... and on the constant verge of disaster.

Mayor Larry Vaughn is welcoming developer Len Peterson and his new resort to Amity.

When his wife Sarah falls off the wagon and dumps him for Jacques, a drug dealer, Frank tries to get her back by reporting her kidnapped, grabbing her from Jacques' car, and wailing for her to return. After watching Christian TV and having a vision, he becomes a superhero to fight evil. He sews a costume, finds a weapon (a pipe wrench) and looks for crimes to stop. He has problems: his wrench inflicts real injury, so the cops want him for being a vigilante, his sense of boundaries is flawed, and Jacques' gang has guns. Libby, a clerk at a comic book store, becomes his sidekick, and it's time to go save Sarah.

However, it's been a while since they've come back together, which is all about to change. When one of their own, Reuben Tishkoff, builds a hotel with another casino owner, Willy Bank, the last thing he ever wanted was to get cut out of the deal personally by the loathsome Bank. Bank's attitude even goes so far as to finding the amusement in Tishkoff's misfortune when the double crossing lands Reuben in the hospital because of a heart attack. However, Danny and his crew won't stand for Bank and what he's done to a friend. Uniting with their old enemy Benedict, who himself has a vendetta against Bank, the crew is out to pull off a major plan; one that will unfold on the night Bank's newest hot spot opens up.

This presents particular challenges as the vampires' food supply - human blood - is dwindling and rationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.                \r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet Minto-Day...Lisa Barrett \r\nJay Laga'aia...Senator Turner \r\nDamien Garvey...Senator Westlake \r\nSahaj Dumpleton...Homeless Vampire \r\nAllan Todd...Businessman \r\nGabriella Di Labio...Businesswoman \r\nBen Siemer...Police Officer \r\nPeter Welman...Police Officer \r\nEthan Hawke...Edward Dalton \r\nCallum McLean...Vampire School Kid \r\nJarrad Pon...Vampire School Kid \r\nVictoria Williams...Vampire School Kid \r\nZoe White...Vampire School Kid \r\nAolani Roy...Vampire School Kid \r\nTiffany Lamb...News Reader \r\n\r\n\r\nDirected byMichael Spierig...(as The Spierig Brothers)            \r\n        Peter Spierig...(as The Spierig Brothers)            \r\n        Writing CreditsMichael Spierig...(written by) (as The Spierig Brothers) &\r\n  Peter Spierig...(written by) (as The Spierig Brothers)\r\n  "

                "Briar Patch is a modern, Southern Gothic tale of true love and murder. It centers on Inez Macbeth, a wisp of a girl just a shade over twenty, who may lack a formal education, but has already been taught plenty by life. She's at a dead end, married to Edgar, a petty thief who had his shot and missed long ago, but is too dense to realize it. She spends her days catering to Edgar's whims and fighting off lame advances from his taciturn partner in crime, Flowers. One day, Butcher Lee, Inez's trusted friend and an amateur mystic of sorts, reveals a vision that Inez's One True Love is close by. Determined not to let this opportunity slip by, she vows to act on that information right away. Unknown to anyone, Inez has begun a secret tryst with Druden, a sweet-spirited, oddly-romantic, and wealthy young lawyer in town. With utter certainty that Druden is The One from Butcher's vision, Inez plans their escape to Richmond. Edgar gets wind Inez is up to something and blows his cool, beating her ...                \r\n\r\n\r\nDominique Swain...Inez Macbeth \r\nHenry Thomas...Edgar Macbeth \r\nArie Verveen...Flowers \r\nJames Urbaniak...Druden Hunt \r\nKaren Allen...Butcher Lee \r\nDebra Monk...Officer Avon \r\nBlake Lindsley...Raeburn \r\nSuzanne Castle...Saleslady \r\nStarla Lee...Jewelry Store Clerk \r\nJudy Simpson...Mrs. Hunt (as Jusy Simpson Cook)\r\nLen Hathaway...Mr. Hunt \r\nStuart Hough...Drunk Man \r\nJoan Thomas...Drunk Woman \r\nSam Froelich...Peanut Factory Foreman \r\nDonald Lee Hall Jr....Policeman \r\n\r\n\r\nDirected byZev Berman\r\n        Writing CreditsDeborah Pryor...(written by)\r\n  "

Discovering she was an Umbrella experiment, Alice has been bio-genetically enhanced with new strengths, senses and dexterity--and she will need them. In the heart of the ravaged Raccoon City, a small group of uninfected people, including Jill Valentine, a recently demoted member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services team, and S.T.A.R.S team leader Carlos Oliveira, fight for their lives against swarms of Undead and the deadlier and faster Lickers. Running out of luck and resources, the group is rescued by Alice, and they begin to wage an exhilarating battle to survive and escape before the Umbrella Corporation erases its experiment from the face of the earth.

Taking stock of their surroundings, they arm themselves, lock down the mall, and destroy the zombies inside so they can eke out a living--at least for a while. Tensions begin to build as months go on, and they come to realize that they've fallen prey to consumerism.

One day on the beach, the groom Danny is attacked and killed by a man who rises up out of the water with no explanation, leaps on top of him, and vomits blood into his mouth. Danny is resuscitated ten minutes later, and seems to look and act totally normal. However, his wife Denise finds out that that's not the case at all. It turns out that Danny has become a zombie. However, instead of becoming a \"Night Of The Living Dead\"-style creature right off the bat, he disintegrates gradually, in a manner akin to cancer or AIDS. He and his wife Denise do their best to cope with his slipping away, not to mention the fact that he can't stop killing and eating people. As their best friends arrive for a weekend visit, she makes him promise her that they're off-limits. He agrees, but finds it more and more difficult to control himself.
